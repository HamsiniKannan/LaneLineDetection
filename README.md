# LaneLineDetection
Developed an algorithm to reliably detect and track lane lines in real-time video streams  under varying road and lighting conditions. Utilized Python and OpenCV for image  processing techniques like grayscale conversion, Canny edge detection, region of  interest masking, and Hough Transform to accurately identify lane boundaries.
